# Index Array Equilibrium

This project shows an interface to interact with the _Index Array Equilibrium API_. It's available at https://paulo9mv.github.io/sum_array_front

## Para executar
This tutorial supposes that you have _yarn_ installed. If you don't have it, follow the instructions at the [official page](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/docs/install/#windows-stable).

1. To install _node\_modules_
```
$ yarn install
```

2. To start the project
```
$ yarn start
```

**NOTE:** The frontend is hosted at Github Pages. The API is hosted at Heroku using Free Dynos, so the first request should take a little bit longer (8s) to execute, because Heroku is changing the API status from **suspended** to **up**.
